# Emotion_Recognition

I've developed a Real-time Emotion Recognition system using OpenCV, a custom CNN model, and the power of Transfer Learning! 🤖📸
My project combines cutting-edge technologies:
1️⃣ OpenCV: OpenCV brought real-time image processing capabilities to the forefront, enabling lightning-fast analysis of human expressions 🚀.
2️⃣ CNN Model: Developed Convolutional Neural Networks to extract intricate features from images📸 . This laid the foundation for precise emotion detection.
3️⃣ Transfer Learning: It involves leveraging a pre-trained model's knowledge 🧠🤖 and fine-tuning it for a specific task.In our case, it helped us detect emotions like happy, surprise, neutral, angry, sad, and fear with better precision!
